Gemini 3 Prompts
First, I start with the hero section. It includes the nav bar, hook, 
description, cta, social proof and visual. I spend 50% of the time here 
because it sets the colors, typography, spacing, which AI uses for the 
rest of the site consistently.
“Create the hero section for my {app} called {name} in the style of 
{reference_site}”.
Pro tip: use a screenshot and you’ll get way better results. Okay, let’s 
get into the details.
For icons, I prompt: “Use Iconify {icon set name}”. Most people use 
Lucide, but there are hundreds of open-source sets on Iconify like Solar, 
HeroIcons, Iconoir, Phosphor, etc.
For the animation, I prompt: “Animate fade in, slide in, blur in, element 
by element. Use 'both' instead of 'forwards'. Don't use opacity 0.”. This 
creates a subtle intro animation the first time users land on your page.
Gemini 3 is an excellent animator. For example, I created the beam with 
this prompt: “Add noodles that connect and beam animate into the right 
circle. Add subtle details to the right beam animation circle with sonar 
and decorations.”
For background animation, I use Unicorn Studio. Remix one of their 
templates and watch people click on your cover like crazy. What can I say, 
people love lasers.
In the hero or right below it, social proof is super important. You can 
put ratings or logos, or both. For logos, you can prompt: “Animate the 
logos with marquee animation looping infinitely using duplicated items and 
alpha mask.”.
Now the CTA. AI always creates basic buttons, which is fine 99% of the 
time. But Gemini 3 also sets a high bar for baseline design, so you will 
need to stand out. That’s why I put the extra human touch on animations 
and lickable buttons. I suggest browsing UIVerse and Codepen for buttons 
and reference the code in your prompt: “Change
main button {code} and secondary button {code}”.
Once you’re happy with the hero, you’ll want to craft new sections based 
on your business. Features, action plan, pricing, testimonials, CTA and 
footer are the popular ones. Insert a screenshot and prompt “Adapt a new 
section, change texts, names and numbers”. Gemini 3 is very smart. It 
reads your existing styles and site concept and will tastefully mold new 
designs to fit perfectly into your current site.
Finally, repeat the same prompts for icons, buttons and animations. Use 
midjourney images and remix using Nano Banana Pro. Ask ChatGPT to come up 
with better hooks, descriptions, names, etc. Don’t skim the human part, 
this is where you’re irreplaceable. Start creating high-converting, 
top-tier landing pages and watch your numbers grow.
